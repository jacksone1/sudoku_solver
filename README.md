# SUDOKU SOLVER #

This is my Science Fair project for 1/18/18. 

### Setup Instructions ###

* There are two files: solver.py and prop.py 
* solver.py solves puzzles using simple elimination. It does not solve all puzzles.
* prop.py solves any puzzle using constraint propagation. My dad made this one.
* Type in the puzzle near the bottom of the page. Use a 0 for a blank square.
* At the command prompt, type `> python prop.py` and it will print the answer.
